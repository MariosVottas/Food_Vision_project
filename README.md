# Food_Vision_project

This repository is a personal mini project for training purposes. The main idea of this project is to surpass the results of the [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment) paper results using Deep Learning techniques with TensorFlow. </br>

The datasets used is the [food101](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/food101#:~:text=This%20dataset%20consists%20of%20101,contain%20some%20amount%20of%20noise.) from TensorFlow Datasets. This dataset is used to classify 101 different classes of food. The goal is to get better results from the DeepFood paper, which had a 77.4% top-1 accuracy score using a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days.
